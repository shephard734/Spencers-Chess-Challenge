# Spencers-Chess-Challenge
A one page website made to show off skills with Django, React.js, and AWS.

# The Basics
This website will display a title at the top and a chessboard below that on the left.
The chessboard will have a simple chess position displayed on it.
To the right of the chessboard will be instructions that tell the user to choose the strongest move that they can find by clicking a piece and its destination.
After selecting a piece, its potential destinations will turn green, indicating that they may be selected.
After selecting a destination, feedback will appear to the right of the board, under a dividing line from the instruction text.
The feedback will be composed of a rating (i.e, 'Best!', 'Good.', 'Blunder...', etc.), Pros, and Cons.
Lastly, text will appear that informs the user what percentage of users chose the same move as they did.

If further functionality is needed or wanted, it will be added below the chessboard and feedback area.
